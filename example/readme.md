# Google Signin sample app

## Prepare
```
npm install
```

## Run

### iOS
open `ios/RNGoogleSigninExample.xcodeproj` and hit the run button.

### android
sadly you need to follow all the steps from the android readme before running the sample app. This is because the `.json` file is dependent on your sha1 developer key.
